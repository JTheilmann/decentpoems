A friend and I are taking part in a hackathon. Our project is called "Decent Poems" and it's a game/experiment in coordination and collective writing. The rules are quite simple: everyone on the website sees the same random word, the first one to write a verse which includes the word wins the round and their verse is added to the page. Then a new word is drawn from a list of 25320 words and the round starts again. On the sixth verse the poem is finalized and sold in an auction, and the preceedings are distributed to everyone who participated in the poem.

The fun part is that you don't know how many others are playing, and you have no clue on what others are writing until you see it in the website. It's a coordination experiment with random people from the internets (what can go wrong?).

We would like to invite a bunch of people to try out on and see what happens ðŸ¤ž, are you with us? You'll need: a) web3 wallet like MetaMask; b) some cryptocurrency to send transactions. We use the Polygon blockchain, so you'll need MATIC. If you don't have any MATIC you can still participate! Give us your wallet address and we will transfer you one MATIC so you don't have to go through the gates of hell of buying crypto.

The first testing session will be on Aug 11th at 18:00 (CEST).

PS: do you have friends with a kink for writing? Feel free to invite them, we can give them a small amount of crypto so they can join the party.
