# What is it

Decent Poems could be called a Decent-ralized Poem writing app.

A smart contract generates a random word, and someone has to write a sentence with it.

Once 7 sentences have been signed into the blockchain, a poem is generated.

The poem immediately goes into a Dutch Auction (also handled by the smart contract) which will allow anyone who loves it to buy it.
This will generate an NFT that can now be traded.

Cherry on the cake: all the revenue (from minting and from the trades royalties) are equally split among the authors, by means o 0xSplit.

Everything is 100% on chain, based on Polygon. So the system could in principle live forever.
